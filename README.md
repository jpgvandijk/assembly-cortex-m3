==================

The source code in this repository (mainly assembly with test functions in C) is targeting the LPC1769 and STM32F103VE:
- Files specific to the LPC are in a "lpc" subdirectory: these files are developed for the LPCXpresso1769
- Files specific to the STM are in a "stm" subdirectory: these files are developed for a custom board or the HY-STM32_100p board with the HY-280_262k TFT

N.B.: make sure to update the makefile to select the correct target and application!

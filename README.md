==================

The source code in this repository (mainly assembly) is targeting the LPC1769 and STM32F103VE:
- Files specific to the LPC are in the "lpc" subdirectory: these files are developed for the LPCXpresso1769
- Files specific to the STM are in the "stm" subdirectory: these files are developed for the HY-STM32_100p board with the HY-280_262k TFT

N.B.: when trying the provided test files (in the "test" subdirectory) make sure the branch to this function is added in main.S!
